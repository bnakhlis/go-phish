A credit score represents the level of risk you could pose to a lender when you borrow money. Your score is calculated by breaking down the positive and negative information found in your report into multiple factors.&nbsp;<\\\/span><\\\/span><span class=\\\"EOP SCXW112102056 BCX0\\\" data-ccp-props=\\\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559739&quot;:300}\\\">&nbsp;<\\\/span><\\\/p>\\n<p aria-level=\\\"3\\\"><strong><span data-contrast=\\\"none\\\">So, what are those factors, anyway?<\\\/span><\\\/strong><span data-ccp-props=\\\"{&quot;134245418&quot;:true,&quot;134245529&quot;:true,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:225}\\\">&nbsp;<\\\/span><\\\/p>\\n<p><span data-contrast=\\\"none\\\">There are different scoring models, which may weigh factors differently. But in a basic sense, here&rsquo;s how scores break down:<\\\/span><span data-ccp-props=\\\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559739&quot;:300}\\\">&nbsp;<\\\/span><\\\/p>\\n<h3><strong><span data-contrast=\\\"none\\\">Payment History<\\\/span><\\\/strong><\\\/h3>\\n<ul>\\n<li><span data-contrast=\\\"none\\\">Making on-time payments consistently is the best way to show you&rsquo;re responsible with credit. This is why it&rsquo;s typically the most important factor of your credit score. For some models, it can make up to 40% of your credit score. <\\\/span><span data-ccp-props=\\\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559739&quot;:300}\\\">&nbsp;<\\\/span><\\\/li>\\n<\\\/ul>\\n<h3><strong><span data-contrast=\\\"none\\\">Utilization<\\\/span><\\\/strong><\\\/h3>\\n<ul>\\n<li><span data-contrast=\\\"none\\\">Another important part of your credit score is related to your balances. Utilization measures how much of your available credit you&rsquo;re using. For instance, if you have a credit card with a limit of $1,000 and your current balance is $400, your utilization percentage is 40%. Best practice is to try to keep your utilization under 30%, but, of course, the lower the better.<\\\/span><span data-ccp-props=\\\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559739&quot;:300}\\\">&nbsp;<\\\/span><\\\/li>\\n<\\\/ul>\\n<h3><strong><span data-contrast=\\\"none\\\">Credit History<\\\/span><\\\/strong><\\\/h3>\\n<ul>\\n<li><span data-contrast=\\\"none\\\">Your credit history can show a lot about your personal journey with credit.

Though, the effects are usually minimal. Each instance where your credit report information has been obtained by a lender or other business considering an application where you&rsquo;ve authorized the business to receive it is reflected on your credit report as a &ldquo;hard inquiry.&rdquo; Because hard inquiries can impact your credit score, it&rsquo;s smart to only apply when necessary. Soft inquiries, which can occur when your existing creditors periodically check your credit in connection with reviewing your account, when you check your own credit reports or if you receive a promotional offer from a company, don&rsquo;t affect your credit score. <\\\/span><span data-ccp-props=\\\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559739&quot;:300}\\\">&nbsp;<\\\/span><\\\/li>\\n<\\\/ul>\\n<p aria-level=\\\"3\\\">&nbsp;<\\\/p>\\n<p aria-level=\\\"3\\\"><strong><span data-contrast=\\\"none\\\">What does this all mean?<\\\/span><\\\/strong><span data-ccp-props=\\\"{&quot;134245418&quot;:true,&quot;134245529&quot;:true,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:225}\\\">&nbsp;<\\\/span><\\\/p>\\n<p><span data-contrast=\\\"none\\\">Generally speaking, the higher the score the better.

Find out how you can set yourself on a better financial path by atoning for some of your worst money missteps.<\\\/p>\\n<p>Nobody\'s perfect &mdash; especially when it comes to managing money. While you may try to keep track of your funds, budget wisely and spend well now, you may have made some serious money mistakes when you were younger. Since having money doesn\'t exactly come with an owner\'s manual, you may have had lackadaisical spending ways or gone wild with credit before you smartened up and started taking money seriously. Still, those past sins can come back to haunt you in the form of creditors or less-than-impressive credit scores. Your best bet is to face money issues head-on and atone for those missteps so you can move forward with better habits.<\\\/p>\\n<h3>Open up<\\\/h3>\\n<p>When dealing with past financial mistakes, it\'s easy to turn a blind eye and hope that they simply go away. But when you owe money or default on loans, not only are those creditors still looking to get paid, it can affect your long-term ability to secure credit and enjoy future financial freedom. Instead, gather up all of your statements and go through them with a fine-tooth comb to give yourself a general picture of which mistakes you\'ve made but can be easily rectified with dedicated work.<\\\/p>\\n<h3>Make a plan<\\\/h3>\\n<p>Once you know where you stand money-wise, it\'s time to create a plan to pay back creditors, and remove any inaccurate information on your credit report. This may require some leg work on your part, so plan on working with creditors on settlement deals, checking your credit report and contacting your creditors or credit reporting agencies to remove inaccuracies that you may have found. Consider your plan like you would a work project: focus, then put your energy into accomplishing it.<\\\/p>\\n<h3>Start small<\\\/h3>\\n<p>No one is saying that you need to put all of your savings toward paying off an old debt to get rid of it. In fact, starting with smaller debts &mdash; an old credit card or small tax bill, for instance - helps you get rid of some of your smaller mistakes, and can also help provide a sense of accomplishment. Start with the most manageable issues. That way, you\'ll have more of a leg to stand on when negotiating with larger creditors.<\\\/p>\\n<h3>Keep it rolling<\\\/h3>\\n<p>Once you\'ve made headway on some of your smaller money mistakes, it\'s time to get serious. Keep up the good work by taking a look at your current budget and cutting back spending to free up money for payment of other debts, or making settlement agreements with other creditors. When you have cash in hand, creditors may be more willing to settle, but you\'ll need to be prepared to act immediately. While it might mean a few months of leaner living, having a clear conscience and rectifying the mistakes of the past can help you move forward with your future financial goals.<\\\/p>\",\"Title\":\"Money Mistakes: How to Rectify Past Financial Sins\"},{\"Content\":\"<p>Trying to improve your finances?

Regular check-ups will also help you guard against identity theft.<br \/><br \/><\\\/li>\\n<li>Improve and raise your credit score above 650: A credit score above 650 may help qualify you for credit. The higher your score, the better the interest rates available to you.<br \/><br \/><\\\/li>\\n<li>Reduce your debt balances to below 35% of your available credit limit: Reducing your balances while maintaining active credit use makes you more appealing to prospective lenders and can help improve your credit score.<br \/><br \/><\\\/li>\\n<li>Create a monthly spending plan and stick to it: This simple commitment can help you start a savings plan and keep you from accruing unmanageable debt.<\\\/li>\\n<\\\/ul>\\n<h3>Update Your Records<\\\/h3>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Dispute inaccuracies on your credit report: Don\'t let your credit standing suffer because of inaccurate information.<br \/><br \/><\\\/li>\\n<li>Most negative records expire from your credit report after 7-10 years. These accounts have a significant negative effect on your credit rating, so make sure they are removed from your report at the right time.<br \/><br \/><\\\/li>\\n<li>Consider refinancing: See if refinancing your home or car could save you money. Investigate your options with a lender.<\\\/li>\\n<\\\/ul>\\n<h3>Plan Ahead<\\\/h3>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Start putting money into a savings account each month: No matter how much available credit you have, it can\'t beat cash in the bank. Setting aside a fixed amount each month will guarantee funds in the case of emergency while helping you develop financial discipline.<br \/><br \/><\\\/li>\\n<li>Contribute to your 401(k): See if your company offers matching funds and try to add the maximum amount allowable for your budget.<\\\/li>\\n<\\\/ul>\\n<p><em><br \/>Please note: This information is for educational purposes only and does not constitute legal or financial advice.

Think again.<\\\/p>\\n<p>Medical collections are becoming increasingly common. If you are injured and your insurance company doesn\'t pay, you can become legally responsible for the bill. That collections account can stay on your credit report for up to seven years if you don\'t prove that it was a factual error. How can you be sure your credit doesn\'t end up with a scar?<\\\/p>\\n<h3>Follow these tips for keeping your credit out of harm\'s way:<\\\/h3>\\n<h4>Prevention<\\\/h4>\\n<ul>\\n<li>\\n<h4>Emergency reserve<\\\/h4>\\n<p>It\'s important to have enough money saved to cover your living expenses for a few months in case you lose your job or unexpectedly land in the hospital. Medical bills can sometimes add up to unbelievable amounts, so you may want to also keep a credit card with a high limit reserved for emergency use.<\\\/p>\\n<\\\/li>\\n<li>\\n<h4>Be flexible<\\\/h4>\\n<p>Flexible Spending Accounts or \\\"Cafeteria Plans\\\" offered through your employer provide an easy pre-tax way to pay for medical expenses. Ask your employer about what plan may be included in your benefits. With this system, you decide how much of your salary to set aside when you sign up for the year. For example, if you choose to pull out $100 a month for the plan, you have $1,200 you can use for medical bill reimbursements that year.<\\\/p>\\n<\\\/li>\\n<li>\\n<h4>Power of attorney<\\\/h4>\\n<p>If things get really sticky, having a trusted spouse or family member with legal power of attorney can help. When you are sick in the hospital, you may not be able to wrestle with the insurance companies and billing offices on your own. Talk to a financial planner or lawyer to have these papers drawn up. Be sure that this person understands the responsibilities and has a copy of your medical insurance policy.<\\\/p>\\n<\\\/li>\\n<\\\/ul>\\n<h3>Prescription<\\\/h3>\\n<ul>\\n<li>\\n<h4>Get the facts<\\\/h4>\\n<p>If you receive a bill you thought was covered, go through your insurance policy with a fine tooth comb to see what you are really responsible for paying. These documents can also outline the best procedures for cutting through the red tape in the billing office. You\'ll also want to contact the insurance company and the medical office for more information as soon as you suspect something is wrong with your bill.<\\\/p>\\n<\\\/li>\\n<li>\\n<h4>Settle your bills<\\\/h4>\\n<p>Even if your insurance company is at fault, you will probably be better off paying the medical bill yourself before it\'s sent to collections rather than continuing to deny the charge. Paying the bill doesn\'t mean you have to stop negotiating with your insurance company over the amount, it just means that you won\'t also have to negotiate over a collection account on your credit report.<\\\/p>\\n<\\\/li>\\n<li>\\n<h4>Righting the wrongs<\\\/h4>\\n<p>If the account was sent to collections, avoid \\\"settling\\\" the bill and try to pay off the amount in full. A fully-paid collections account is better for your credit than an unpaid or settled account. If your medical bill was sent to collections in error, you still have options. You can dispute the record on your credit report if you can prove that the bill was sent to collections unlawfully (for example &mdash; if you were never billed directly for the amount before it was sent to collections).<\\\/p>\\n<\\\/li>\\n<\\\/ul>\",\"Title\":\"Unpaid Medical Bills and Your Credit Report\"},{\"Content\":\"<p><span data-contrast=\\\"auto\\\">It\'s one thing to know what interest is. It\'s another to truly understand how interest works. Understanding interest is so important because it can have a considerable impact on your entire financial picture.<\\\/span><span data-ccp-props=\\\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true}\\\">&nbsp;<\\\/span><\\\/p>\\n<p><span data-contrast=\\\"auto\\\">The most important thing to know about interest is that not all types are created equal. The way you calculate interest can drastically alter the results. Taking that into account, let\'s discuss the two main types of interest:<\\\/span><span data-ccp-props=\\\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true}\\\">&nbsp;<\\\/span><\\\/p>\\n<h3>Simple or Nominal Interest<\\\/h3>\\n<p><span data-contrast=\\\"auto\\\">When you learned about interest in school, simple interest was probably the kind you were first taught. The amount of simple interest is calculated as a percentage of the principal amount. Put another way, with simple interest, the principal amount upon which the interest is calculated, is constant.<\\\/span><span data-ccp-props=\\\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true}\\\">&nbsp;<\\\/span><\\\/p>\\n<p><span data-contrast=\\\"auto\\\">This is easy to understand when you think about a savings account. Say you deposit $10,000 with an annual interest rate of 5%. Now let\'s say you let that $10,000 sit there for 5 years. What would the new amount be? If you said $12,500, then you would be correct. Our deposit (the principal) earned $500 (5% of 10,000) each year for five years. That leaves us with $12,500.<\\\/span><span data-ccp-props=\\\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true}\\\">&nbsp;<\\\/span><\\\/p>\\n<h3>Compound Interest<\\\/h3>\\n<p>Remember how with simple interest the amount upon which interest is calculated stayed the same (every year it was based on $10,000)? Well, with compound interest, that amount continues to accumulate on itself. Compound interest is calculated based on the principal amount and any past interest earned. <sup>1<\\\/sup>The earned interest is simply added to the original principal amount at a predetermined rate (annually, monthly, etc.).<\\\/p>\\n<p>Compound interest might be better understood by example. Let\'s look back at our savings account scenario once again. This time, however, let\'s say at the end of each year your earned interest is added back to the original principal amount. After year 1, just like with simple interest, you would have earned $500 in interest. This time, though, the difference is that $500 is now added to the $10,000. So the following year\'s principal becomes $10,500 and that year\'s interest is calculated based on that new figure. This process repeats itself every year for 5 years. At the end of 5 years, with interest compounding at a yearly rate, we would actually end up with $12,763, leaving us with $263 more than simple interest.<\\\/p>\\n<p>$263 is hardly an impressive extra profit, but hold that thought. Let\'s say you let that $10,000 sit for 10 years instead of 5. In that case, the simple interest would leave you with $15,000. On the other hand, compound interest would leave you with $16,288. That\'s an extra profit of $1,288! As you can see, allowing compound interest to build and grow over a longer period of time can make a big difference.<\\\/p>\\n<p><strong>Just ask Warren Buffett how powerful compound interest can be:<\\\/strong><\\\/p>\\n<p>\\\"My wealth has come from a combination of living in America, some lucky genes, and compound interest.\\\" &mdash; Warren Buffett<sup>2<\\\/sup><\\\/p>\\n<p>Most of us are not Warren Buffet. The beauty of compound interest, though, is that anyone can take advantage of its financial power. Whether you have a mortgage, are repaying student loans, or even depositing money in a bank account, interest has the power to add to your debt or help build your savings. Knowing what interest is won\'t help you truly take advantage. Rather, it\'s understanding how it can best work for you.<\\\/p>\\n<p><span style=\\\"font-size: 8pt;\\\">[1]&nbsp;<a href=\\\"https:\/\/www.investor.gov\/glossary\/glossary_terms\/compound-interest\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\">https:\/\/www.investor.gov\/glossary\/glossary_terms\/compound-interest<\\\/a><\\\/span><br \/><span style=\\\"font-size: 8pt;\\\">[2]&nbsp;<a href=\\\"http:\/\/archive.fortune.com\/2010\/06\/15\/news\/newsmakers\/Warren_Buffett_Pledge_Letter.fortune\/index.htm\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\">http:\/\/archive.fortune.com\/2010\/06\/15\/news\/newsmakers\/Warren_Buffett_Pledge_Letter.fortune\/index.htm<\\\/a><\\\/span><\\\/p>\\n<p>&nbsp;<\\\/p>\\n<p>&nbsp;<\\\/p>\",\"Title\":\"The Importance of Understanding Interest\"},{\"Content\":\"<p><span data-contrast=\\\"auto\\\">Do you cringe when you hear the word budgeting? If so, you aren\'t alone. Creating a budget requires planning and a lot of work to record all financial transactions made in a household. It\'s even more work to keep spending within the limits of your monthly income.<\\\/span><span data-ccp-props=\\\"{}\\\">&nbsp;<\\\/span><\\\/p>\\n<p><span data-contrast=\\\"auto\\\">Some people find it difficult to remember to record each and every item purchased, while others are surprised when they see how much money they spend on small things like daily coffee. If you don\'t use some form of a budget, however, you run the risk of continually spending more money than you bring home or spending more money than you realize on things you don\'t need. You could also be at risk for missing payments on credit accounts, which may have a damaging effect on your credit history and score. No matter which financial life-stage your family is in, it\'s never too late to create a household budget.<\\\/span><span data-ccp-props=\\\"{}\\\">&nbsp;<\\\/span><\\\/p>\\n<p><span data-contrast=\\\"auto\\\">Recording how much of your monthly income goes to pay various bills and expenses will help you see where you may be spending more money than expected. Cutting unnecessary expenses frees up cash to increase emergency and long-term savings or pay down debt faster. Planning monthly spending so it doesn\'t exceed your monthly income can prevent you from turning to credit cards or loans to cover your regular monthly bills. Sticking to a budget can also help families, who would otherwise scramble to find the cash, to make their monthly mortgage or loan payments on time.<\\\/span><span data-ccp-props=\\\"{}\\\">&nbsp;<\\\/span><\\\/p>\\n<h3>Set up a basic budget<\\\/h3>\\n<p><span class=\\\"TextRun SCXW216358562 BCX0\\\" lang=\\\"EN-US\\\" xml:lang=\\\"EN-US\\\" data-contrast=\\\"auto\\\"><span class=\\\"NormalTextRun SCXW216358562 BCX0\\\">Record your net monthly family income which is your total income from all sources less taxes, and other deductions from your gross wages.

It will also lower your taxable income which may result in a lower tax rate for you. If your company matches your contribution, this will boost your retirement savings even further.<\\\/li>\\n<li>Consider an IRA account. If you don\'t have access to a company-sponsored 401(k) plan, consider a Roth or traditional individual retirement account (IRA). Just finding an extra $30 a week in your budget could make this a reality.<br \/><br \/><\\\/li>\\n<li>Set up automatic deposits to a savings account.

And while your primary focus may be on creating a plan to pay off those loans efficiently, it&rsquo;s important to know that your student loans can influence other areas of your financial life as well, like your credit health. Student loans are a type of installment loan, which work similarly to auto loans and mortgages. While student loans are very different from credit cards, they can play an important role in helping you build credit history and will impact your credit score in various ways.<\\\/span><\\\/span><span class=\\\"EOP SCXW60495085 BCX0\\\" data-ccp-props=\\\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559739&quot;:300}\\\">&nbsp;<\\\/span><\\\/p>\\n<h3><strong><span data-contrast=\\\"none\\\">Payment history<\\\/span><\\\/strong><span data-ccp-props=\\\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559739&quot;:300}\\\">&nbsp;<\\\/span><\\\/h3>\\n<p><span data-contrast=\\\"none\\\">The most important thing you can do to maintain healthy credit is make sure you&rsquo;re paying your bills on time &mdash; student loans are no exception.

This is sometimes called a hard pull. A hard pull or hard inquiry can lower your credit score.

Currently, Direct PLUS loans are the only federal student loan option that will result in a hard inquiry. This type of loan is only available to graduate and professional students, and parents of undergraduate students. Private student loan lenders may request to obtain your credit report as a condition of loan approval, which may result in a hard inquiry that can impact your credit score. It&rsquo;s smart to shop around for the best private student loan rates. To minimize the impact of multiple hard inquiries, try to complete your applications in a short timeframe, ideally within two weeks.

An older average age of credit accounts is better. After you receive a student loan, it will be reported by the lender to the credit reporting agencies and be added to your credit report. This will help you build your credit history. And since you&rsquo;re likely to pay off student loans over a long period, they can help you begin establishing credit while also helping you maintain a higher average credit age until they&rsquo;re paid off and the accounts are closed.<\\\/span><span data-ccp-props=\\\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559739&quot;:300}\\\">&nbsp;<\\\/span><\\\/p>\\n<h3><strong><span data-contrast=\\\"none\\\">Credit mix<\\\/span><\\\/strong><span data-ccp-props=\\\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559739&quot;:300}\\\">&nbsp;<\\\/span><\\\/h3>\\n<p><span data-contrast=\\\"none\\\">In general, having a variety of account types, like different installment loans and credit cards, can have a positive effect on your credit score. Some young adults may only have a credit card or be an authorized user on someone else&rsquo;s credit card account, prior to getting a student loan. Student loans add to your credit mix, which can help your score over time. However, when the student loan account is closed, your credit mix may become less diverse, which could lower your score. But don&rsquo;t let that concern you too much, as paying off student loan debt as efficiently as possible is a smart move for your financial health.<\\\/span><span data-ccp-props=\\\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559739&quot;:300}\\\">&nbsp;<\\\/span><\\\/p>\\n<p><span data-contrast=\\\"none\\\">In many cases, if you have a thin credit file, student loans can help you build a credit history.

A student credit card may be a good bet for college students because they generally have lower limits. But be sure your young adult does their research and finds the best fit for their situation. Opening a card, keeping the balance low and making on-time payments can help young adults build their financial resume&rsquo;s story of responsibility, which could lead to more creditworthiness in the future.<\\\/span><span data-ccp-props=\\\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:2,&quot;335559739&quot;:600,&quot;335559740&quot;:390}\\\">&nbsp;<\\\/span><\\\/p>\",\"Title\":\"How to Prepare your Young Adult for Financial Independence\"},{\"Content\":\"<p>Buying your first car is considerably more expensive than the sticker price reveals. Prepare yourself for the unavoidable expenditures that come along for the ride.<\\\/p>\\n<p>Buying your first car? Congratulations! Before you plan your first road trip, though, there are several important financial factors to consider as you prepare to purchase this big ticket item.<\\\/p>\\n<h3>Not just the sticker price<\\\/h3>\\n<p>Buyer, beware. The sticker price posted on the window at any auto dealership, or even the listed price of a private sale, is actually considerably less than what you will need to pay to get your car on the road. Taxes and fees can vary depending upon the state in which you live, but there are some common threads that add up to unavoidable expenditures.<\\\/p>\\n<p>You should be prepared to pay sales tax on the vehicle before you ever pull out of the dealership\'s parking lot. Your sales consultant will calculate this tax based upon the current rate in your state and will include it in your bottom line. The dealership will then submit the tax payment to the state government directly.<\\\/p>\\n<h3>Taxes, taxes, taxes<\\\/h3>\\n<p>Many states also assess an excise or personal property tax based on the book value of your vehicle. This tax is assessed and collected annually and is generally not included as part of the fee package charged by your dealership. Be prepared to receive this bill at a later date.<\\\/p>\\n<h3>Registration, license plate and inspection fees<\\\/h3>\\n<p>Speaking of your state government, it will also want to make sure your car has been safety inspected, is registered and easily identifiable &mdash; all at additional cost to you. Many dealerships, especially new car dealerships, will manage the trip to the Registry (or Department) of Motor Vehicles for you. You\'ll see your registration and license plate fees appear in the breakdown of charges on your invoice. Find out in advance if your dealership handles this end of the deal. Most states allow you a certain number of days within which the vehicle must be registered before penalties apply, so you\'ll need to plan ahead if you\'ll be completing this task yourself.<\\\/p>\\n<p>Even if your new ride has just rolled off the assembly line, you may be required to have the vehicle inspected by a licensed garage. Most states require an annual inspection. The garage will inspect all the lights and other safety features, plus run an emissions test before stickering your car. Your inspection sticker is good for a year and also must be completed within a set period of time after purchase. For specifics in your state, check with your dealership.<\\\/p>\\n<h3>The Basics<\\\/h3>\\n<p>If you are buying your first car because you\'re just getting a driver\'s license for the first time, this is an expense to consider, as well. Your written and road tests usually carry a charge separate from paying for the driver\'s license itself. As you finalize your budgeting, factor in the cost of general maintenance and scheduled servicing, such as oil changes and tire rotations. And of course, gas is a regular expense! Be certain you\'ve selected a car that not only meets your budget, but also is efficient enough to meet your needs.<\\\/p>\",\"Title\":\"Buying Your First Car: What You Need to Know\"},{\"Content\":\"<p>There are many reasons to give to charity. The first, of course, is to lend your support to a cause in which you believe. But many people don\'t realize that donating to charity is a win-win situation at tax time.<\\\/p>\\n<h3>It could be deductible!<\\\/h3>\\n<p>Many people take the standard deduction on their 1040s. The current standard deduction parameters allow $12,600 for couples filing jointly or $6,300 for individuals. If your tax deductible spending is higher than allowed under the standard deduction, it\'s a good idea to fill out Schedule A and itemize further deductions. This is where those donations to charity may put cash back in your pocket.<\\\/p>\\n<h3>Qualified charitable organizations<\\\/h3>\\n<p>Before you give, you may want to find out if your charity of choice is a qualified charitable organization. This means that the charity has registered with the government and has been designated a 501(c)(3) organization. If so, you can deduct your donations. Some smaller charities, such as individual churches may not be required to file for 501(c)(3) status but donations to them may also be tax deductible.<\\\/p>\\n<p>Donations to individuals, political campaigns and foreign charities don\'t generally fall under the umbrella of qualified organizations. If you are unsure about a group\'s status, search the IRS website to find out if they\'re qualified.<\\\/p>\\n<h3>Keep your receipts<\\\/h3>\\n<p>In order to claim charitable deductions on your tax return, you\'ll need to have receipts from the charity on hand, noting the date and dollar amount of each donation. Canceled checks or credit card statements verify your claims as well. In the event that you have donated goods to the charity, such as gently used clothing, books or household goods, you\'ll have to generate a fair market value for the items donated and have your figure validated by the charity. If the total value of your non-cash contributions is greater than $500, be prepared to file a Form 8283 along with your 1040 and Schedule A.<\\\/p>\\n<p>While you don\'t have to mail in your receipts with your tax return, be careful to maintain them with your records. In the event of an audit, these receipts will be critical in proving that your deductions are valid.<\\\/p>\\n<h3>How it\'s done<\\\/h3>\\n<p>Schedule A of the IRS Form 1040 is fairly user-friendly. Lines 16 through 19 apply to those who give to charity. You will enter your cash contributions, non-cash contributions, any carryover you may have from a prior year (a less common situation) and the sum of your charitable deductions. This amount will be tallied on the Schedule A, along with other deductions you are entitled to, and deducted from your gross income before your tax is calculated.<\\\/p>\\n<p>Lending your support to a cause you believe in and saving at tax time&hellip;talk about a win-win situation!<\\\/p>\",\"Title\":\"Give to Charity: A Win-Win at Tax Time\"},{\"Content\":\"<p>Do you wonder if you\'re doing the right things with your finances? Perhaps you don\'t know where to focus your attention. As we move through adulthood, we pass through several financial life stages and make budget, debt and investing choices. Understanding where you are and which financial management activities commonly occur at your life stage can help you meet your goals.<\\\/p>\\n<h3>College<\\\/h3>\\n<p>Young adults attending college often need time to adjust to being in charge of their own finances. Between applying for student loans and credit cards, and struggling with budgeting on a student income, college students may find it difficult to balance cash flow. Establish good credit habits, such as paying credit card bills on time, staying out of overdraft on bank accounts, and keeping your credit balances below their limits. It can take years to improve a negative credit history, so start strong and do your best to keep your credit healthy!<\\\/p>\\n<h3>First Job<\\\/h3>\\n<p>Graduating from college and entering the workforce brings new financial management challenges, such as making regular student loan payments. Once you are employed, you may want to apply for a car loan or increase your credit card limit. Now is also the time to start a savings program. As you earn promotions or raises, start contributing to short and long-term savings, especially an emergency fund. Continue to make all payments on time and review your credit file annually to verify the information is correct. In the near future, you may need a mortgage loan, and good credit could help qualify you for a lower interest rate.<\\\/p>\\n<h3>Establishing a Home and Family<\\\/h3>\\n<p>Marriage, children, and home ownership make this a busy life stage. Budgeting for household bills, loan payments, emergency savings, education savings, and retirement planning often requires careful financial management. Take time now to fine-tune financial plans. Inquire about life insurance to protect your family members from financial pressure should anything happen to you. As you apply for joint credit products, remember that you and your partner are equally responsible for repaying jointly borrowed money. Negative credit will affect both of your credit files.<\\\/p>\\n<h3>Wealth-Building<\\\/h3>\\n<p>If you have managed your credit responsibly to this point, your credit file and score may work in your favor. Continue to check your credit annually. A good credit score may help you get reduced interest rates on a mortgage refinance or limit increases. While your equity and savings grow, your debt and outstanding credit balances should be declining.<\\\/p>\\n<h3>Retirement<\\\/h3>\\n<p>For many people, an ideal retirement includes spending time with loved ones, pursuing travel and other leisure activities. Even if your borrowing activity slows in retirement, continue to check your credit report annually. Identifying any out-of-the-ordinary activity, such as inquiries from unknown companies or people, can alert you to potential issues such as attempted identity theft.<\\\/p>\",\"Title\":\"Plan Financial Management Reviews at Each Life Stage\"}],\"Section_Title\":\"Financial Planning\"}],\"Articles_Title\":\"Education\"}},\"category\":\"Content\",\"type\":\"Site\"},\"name\":\"default_en-US_Articles\",\"id\":\"default_en-US_Articles\",\"type\":\"DCR\"},{\"dcr\":{\"dcrContent\":{\"Content\":{\"Overview_Factors_ViewLess\":\"View less factors\",\"Overview_Factors_ViewAll\":\"View all factors\"}},\"category\":\"Content\",\"type\":\"Site\"},\"replicatable\":\"false\",\"name\":\"BoltCard_en-US_Overview\",\"exposed\":\"true\",\"id\":\"BoltCard_en-US_Overview\",\"type\":\"DCR\"},{\"dcr\":{\"dcrContent\":{\"Content\":{\"FAQ_Section\":[{\"Item\":[{\"Content\":\"<p>CreditView Dashboard<sup>&reg; <\\\/sup>provides you access to a dashboard that highlights your key credit information, such as your TransUnion credit score, score trending and national score comparison.<\\\/p>\",\"Title\":\"What is the CreditView Dashboard<sup>\u00AE<\\\/sup>?\"},{\"Content\":\"<p>The simulator shows you how your credit score could increase or decrease based on changes to your credit behavior.

It is not an endorsement or a determination of your qualification for a loan. Lenders use credit scores to help determine whether or not you are a good candidate for a loan and what interest rate you will pay. However, each lender has specific underwriting standards, so you should not assume that you will receive the same evaluation from each lender. As part of the underwriting process, they will incorporate additional information you provide and may obtain references. In addition, even if you are approved, the terms and conditions of loans vary from lender to lender. The information used to determine your credit score comes from one of the three major credit bureaus \\u2014 TransUnion, Equifax and Experian. Credit reports are a compilation of credit information that is reported to the applicable bureau by the various lending institutions with which you have accounts. The information contained in your report reflects the latest information provided to the applicable bureau. If you recently made a payment, opened a new account, or authorized an inquiry, it may not yet be reflected in the credit report of any one of the bureaus you receive. Likewise, if the information is not included in the applicable credit report it will not be reflected in your credit score based on such report.

If you seek, but not qualify for such waiver, we will consider a written request from you to advance all or part of the filing fee.<\\\/li>\\n<\\\/ul>\\n<p>The arbitration will be based only on the written submissions of the parties and the documents submitted to the AAA relating to the dispute, unless either party requests that the arbitration be conducted using the AAA&rsquo;s telephonic, online, or in-person procedures (additional charges may apply for these procedures). Any arbitration proceeding will take place at a location within the federal judicial district that includes the most recent U.S. Mail address we have on file for you at the time the Claim is filed or at any other mutually acceptable location.<br \/><br \/>The arbitrator will be required to follow relevant law and applicable judicial precedent to arrive at a decision and shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in court.

However, we will not demand arbitration pursuant to this Arbitration Agreement in connection with any individual Claim that you properly file and pursue in a small-claims court of your state or municipality, so long as the Claim is pending only in that court.

Unless a different procedure is required by applicable law, the arbitration will be conducted before a single arbitrator in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association (&ldquo;AAA&rdquo;), including the AAA&rsquo;s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes.<\\\/p>\\n<p>A demand for arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement may be made either before or after a lawsuit or other legal proceeding begins. However, any demand for arbitration that is made after a lawsuit or other legal proceeding has begun must be made within 90 days following the service of a complaint, third-party complaint, cross-claim or counterclaim or any answer thereto or any amendment to any of the above.<\\\/p>\\n<p>You understand and agree that before you take a dispute to arbitration under this Agreement, you must first contact our customer account representatives and give us an opportunity to resolve this dispute. Similarly, before TransUnion Interactive takes a dispute to arbitration, we must first attempt to resolve it by contacting you. If the dispute cannot be satisfactorily resolved within sixty days from the date you or TransUnion Interactive is notified by the other of a dispute, either party may then contact the AAA in writing and request arbitration of the dispute. Information about the arbitration process and the AAA&rsquo;s arbitration rules and its fees are available from the AAA on the Internet at <a href=\\\"http:\/\/www.adr.org\\\">http:\/\/www.adr.org<\\\/a>.<\\\/p>\\n<p>The cost of any arbitration proceeding shall be divided as follows:<\\\/p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>If you initiate arbitration, you will be responsible for paying one half of the filing fee, or $125.00, whichever is less, when the demand for arbitration is made.<\\\/li>\\n<li>If we initiate arbitration, we will be responsible for paying all arbitration costs.<\\\/li>\\n<li>Regardless of who initiates the arbitration, you will not be responsible for any arbitration fees that exceed one half of the filing fee, or $125.00, whichever is less, or the fees that you would have incurred if the Claim had been brought in court. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if you believe the cost of arbitration may be too burdensome, you may seek a waiver of the filing fee under the applicable arbitration rules. If you seek, but not qualify for such waiver, we will consider a written request from you to advance all or part of the filing fee.<\\\/li>\\n<\\\/ul>\\n<p>The arbitration will be based only on the written submissions of the parties and the documents submitted to the AAA relating to the dispute, unless either party requests that the arbitration be conducted using the AAA&rsquo;s telephonic, online, or in-person procedures (additional charges may apply for these procedures). Any arbitration proceeding will take place at a location within the federal judicial district that includes the most recent U.S. Mail address we have on file for you at the time the Claim is filed or at any other mutually acceptable location.<\\\/p>\\n<p>The arbitrator will be required to follow relevant law and applicable judicial precedent to arrive at a decision and shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in court. Where authorized by applicable law, the arbitrator&rsquo;s award may include attorneys&rsquo; fees and other expenses. You understand and agree that you and TransUnion Interactive are entering into this arbitration agreement in connection with a transaction involving interstate commerce. Accordingly, this arbitration agreement and any proceedings hereunder shall be governed by and enforceable under the Federal Arbitration Act (&ldquo;FAA&rdquo;), 9 U.S.C. &sect;&sect;1-16.<\\\/p>\\n<p>Any party to the arbitration proceeding may enter judgment upon the arbitration award in any court having jurisdiction over the arbitration award and may have that judgment enforced by any court having jurisdiction over that judgment.

The appeal panel, which will consist of three arbitrators, will consider all factual and legal issues anew, will conduct the appeal in the same manner as the initial arbitration, and will make decisions based on the vote of the majority. We will advance any fees and costs required by AAA to commence any appeal. The appeal panel&rsquo;s decision shall be final and binding.<\\\/p>\\n<p>In the event of a conflict between the applicable arbitration rules and this Arbitration Agreement, this Arbitration Agreement shall govern.
